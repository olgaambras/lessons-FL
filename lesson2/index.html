                        AI is the ability of a machine to display human-like capabilities such as reasoning, learning, planning and creativity.
                    AI enables technical systems to perceive their environment, deal with what they perceive, solve problems and act to
                    achieve a specific goal. The computer receives data - already prepared or gathered through its own sensors such as a
                    camera - processes it and responds.
                    AI systems are capable of adapting their behaviour to a certain degree by analysing the effects of previous actions and
                    working autonomously.

            <h2>Why is AI important?</h2>
            <p id="2-id">
                    Some AI technologies have been around for more than 50 years, but advances in computing power, the availability of
                    enormous quantities of data and new algorithms have led to major AI breakthroughs in recent years.
                    Artificial intelligence is seen as central to the digital transformation of society and it has become an EU priority.
                    Future applications are expected to bring about enormous changes, but AI is already present in our everyday lives.

                <p>
                        Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalised recommendations to people, based for example
                        on their
                        previous searches and purchases or other online behaviour. AI is hugely important in commerce: optimising
                        products,
                        planning inventory, logistics etc.

                    Search engines learn from the vast input of data, provided by their users to provide relevant search results.

                    Smartphones use AI to provide services that are as relevant and personalised as possible. Virtual assistants answering
                    questions, providing recommendations and helping organise daily routines have become ubiquitous.

                <p>
                    Language translation software, either based on written or spoken text, relies on artificial intelligence to provide and
                    improve translations. This also applies to functions such as automated subtitling.

                <p>
                    Smart thermostats learn from our behaviour to save energy, while developers of smart cities hope to regulate traffic to
                    improve connectivity and reduce traffic jams.

                    While self-driving vehicles are not yet standard, cars already use AI-powered safety functions. The EU has for example
                    helped to fund VI-DAS, automated sensors that detect possible dangerous situations and accidents.
